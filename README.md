# sumac-theme
A macOS 12 style demo for KDE Plasma.

Because it is difficult to replicate the style of another OS perfectly, there are 3 versions.
* Sumac: Otherwise known as regular. It is not perfect, but should work reasonably well.
* Summaculate: A portmanteau of 'sumac' and 'immaculate' that tries to come close. May break a few things along the way.
* SumacDoncsugar: A variant used by myself. In other words, it is more suitable for daily use, but may be hacky.
